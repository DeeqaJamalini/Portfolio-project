# My portfolio project


This is a simple black and white portfolio website created using HTML, SCSS, and CSS. The design focuses on minimalism, allowing the work to speak for itself.

At the moment there is actually no work to marvel at but stay tuned for the next episode to see those.

The portfolio site is responsive and adjusts to laptops as well as an entire half of your mobile screen!
